# Mirrors-Edge-Discord-Bot
A Discord bot with the theme of mirrors edge. Specifically made for the Mirrors Edge community discord.

After many people telling me I should post this on github I finally decided to do it, even though I have been hesitant because this code is of my early days... and still pretty amateuristic. I hope you can make good use of this code to learn how a discord bot works. 

Please note: When I first wrote this bot I 1. Did not know Javascript and 2. never thought It would become this big of a project, I began writing this in a ''quick and dirty'' way, but it become so fun and so much used, I decided to slowly add more ''quick and dirty'' on top of ''quick and dirty''. This is why there is lots of ''spaghetti code'' but I will soon refactor this. 

Run node bot.js in the commandline to start, don't forget to create your own auth.json file and don't forget the discord.js API with the node modules!

Feature showcase:
The bot logs in when you initialize it in the commandline with ''node bot.js''

Every X seconds, the bot throws a bag of any rarity, the user types !grab to grab the runnerbag.

By typing !runners, you can see the leaderboard, you get a special mirrors edge themed role according your number of points
