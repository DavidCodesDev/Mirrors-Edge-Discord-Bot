# Mirrors-Edge-Discord-Bot
A Discord bot with the theme of mirrors edge. Specifically made for the Mirrors Edge community discord.

After many people telling me I should post this on github I finally decided to do it, even though I have been hesitant because this code is of my early days... and still pretty amateuristic. I hope you can make good use of this code. 

Please note: When I first wrote this bot I 1. Did not know Javascript and 2. never thought It would become this big of a project, I began writing this in a ''quick and dirty'' way, but it become so fun and so much used, I decided to slowly add more ''quick and dirty'' on top of ''quick and dirty''. This is why there is lots of ''spaghetti code'' but I will soon refactor this. 

Run node bot.js in the commandline to start, don't forget to create your own auth.json file and don't forget the discord.js API with the node modules!
